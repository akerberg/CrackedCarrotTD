<h1>How to play</h1>
RabbiTDefence is a classic tower defence game. The goal of this game is to prevent enemies from crossing the map by building towers which shoot at them as they pass by. When an enemy is eliminated, you will earn an amount of money (depending on level of the enemies).
 With the money earned you can  buy new towers or upgrade already existing ones.<br />
<br />
For more information about enemies. Press &quot;back&quot; then &quot;Creatures&quot;.<br />
<br />
<strong>To buy towers</strong> - use the buttons in the bottom of the screen, when u have selected the tower you want  place it at free spot on the grid. By clicking one of the already placed towers - a options menu will appear at the bottom of the screen: Sell, upgrade (regular), upgrade (special ability 1) and upgrade (special ability 2). By using one of these buttons - you'll either sell your tower (getting less money back than you have invested) or upgrade your tower to become more powerful. <br>

<br>To read more about the towers and their upgrades: Press &quot;back&quot; the &quot;Towers&quot;. 
<br>
<br>
<strong>To win</strong> - You have to defeat all levels without losing all of your &quot;life points&quot;. For each enemy that reaches your garden you will loose one &quot;life point&quot; (The amount of life points depends on the game difficulty).<br />
