 <h1>Multiplayer</h1>
When you're done playing the singleplayer-game and think there is nothing more
anyone can teach you it's time to step it up a bit and take on the most
challenging prey of all - man.<br />
<br />
 <strong>How to play:</strong><br />
When you're playing multiplayer the game is a little bit different than the
standard gameplay. Now you're competing against your friends to get the highest
score while trying to lose the least amount of carrots. To aid you in this you
have a number of new abilities you can purchase and punish your opponent with.<br>
<br>
 <strong>Special abilities:</strong><br />
 <li>Carrot Lover</li>Steal some of your opponent's carrots. Cannot be used to
 win the game. Costs 100 gold.<br>
 <li>Teardown Tower</li>Destroys a random opponent tower. A favourite among
 the developers. Costs 200 gold.<br>
 <li>Shield</li>Protects you against one incoming special ability. Costs 400 gold.<br>
 <li>Enraged Critters</li>The critters attacking your opponent gains
 unnatural abilities, turning them into horrible adversaries. Costs 200 gold.<br>
 <li>sen var det en till</li>glomt bort.<br>
<br>
 <strong>Pairing:</strong><br />
In order to successfully connect to each other both phones must have Bluetooth
enabled and be paired up before starting the game. Then one player hosts the game
and the other and the other joins.<br>
If there are problems connecting or maintaining connection please try moving closer
together or switching who is hosting and who is joining.<br>
<br>
 <strong>Hints:</strong><br />
 <li>Think about how you build your towers and spend your money. If you both kill
 the same amount of critters the interest will tip the scale...<br>
 <li>Some of the new abilities are good all-around, others have their special
 purpose.<br>
 <li>When playing multiplayer the waves change a bit compared to normal play...<br>
