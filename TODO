HIGH PRIORITY:

Dead Creatures need to stay fully visible for some time. They fade to fast at the moment
I suggest we start the fade out when the level ends.. Creating a impressive string of
corpses during the level. 
-- Henrik

We need a currency display. ATM the player cant tell how much money he has.
-- JOHAN

We need a player health display. ATM the player cant tell how much health he has.
Maybe a cute heart next to the number of lifes.

Tower upgrade ui is super important
--Albin

Tower range indicator is missing.
--Albin

The game never really ends, no highscore nothing.
--FREDRIK

Towers class still needs cleaning/refactoring badly
--Henrik




MEDIUM PRIORITY:

Support for animated sprites, explosions etc..
--Albin

Possibly support for texture blending for frost/fire effects on the creatures.
--Albin

Multiplayer support.

Countdown timer. In the gameloop we have a countdown before level starts so players dont feel stressed. 
It would be really nice if the timer is shown instead of progress bar until lvl begins
--Anyone

Balancing of the game. Create more levels balance towers etc.
--Henrik

More detailed information between levels. The player have to know what kind of creatures he will be facing
before next level starts
--Henrik

Main menu -> Options menu. We need to have possible sound settings before game starts.
--FREDRIK

Gamespeed. The game is designed to have different gamespeeds. We have to implement a button and test this.
--Anyone
